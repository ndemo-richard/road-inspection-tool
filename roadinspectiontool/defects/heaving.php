            <h4>Description: </h4>
 
Usually heaving/shoving occurs on either side of the wheel tracks. The irregularities are associated 
with deformation and subsidence. 
			<h4>Possible Causes:</h4> 
 
- Ingress of water: reduced bearing capacity of the pavement. 
- Materials: of poor quality. 
- Workmanship: insufficient compaction. 
- Traffic: passage of vehicles which are too heavy for the pavement structure.
           <h4> Effect (if neglected):</h4> 
 
- Forcing up of weak materials as deformation occurs. 
- Progressive disintegration of the pavement.
         <h4>Inspection Reporting Method:</h4> 
 
- Scaling of sub-section length. 
			<h4>Inspection Tools:</h4> 
 
- Tape

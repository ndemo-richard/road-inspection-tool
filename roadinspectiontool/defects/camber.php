centre portion of the road surface, thereby trapping or preventing surface water from draining away. 
<h4>Possible Causes: </h4>
 
-  Poor construction or maintenance practice. 
<h4>Effect (if neglected): </h4>
 
-  Flooding and water penetration causing softening of pavement and making the road impassable. 
<h4>Inspection Reporting Method: </h4>
 
-  Defect ranking. 
<h4>Inspection Tools:</h4>
